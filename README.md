  <h2> Business cases where prometheus transformed applications </h2>
 <strong> 🖥️ Considering your application consist of multiple microservices , which are interdepenedent on each other , in some case one of your service fails , followed by which you experience 
  multiple service failure in your cluster , without <kbd>Monitoring tool</kbd> you cannot get exact insights , or supposedly you won't be able to trace down what went wrong , casuing this 
  issue
  </strong>

  <br> </br>

  🚥🚨 But surely with a monitoring tool like  ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/prometheus-pink)  , you will get notified, when a particular service goes down , so you can quickly trace back and fix it , with constact monitoring of metrics .
